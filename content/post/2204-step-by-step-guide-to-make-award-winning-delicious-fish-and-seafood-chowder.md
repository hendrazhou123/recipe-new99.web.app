- "2 tablespoons Olive oil"
- "500 g skinned and boned white fish such as basa cod or flake"
- "1 x boned salmon tail"
- "500 g shelled and deveined small prawnsshrips"
- "4 large potatos roughly chopped"
- "4 celery stalks roughly chopped into 45 cm pieces"

- "250 ml thickened cream"
- "1 tablespoon dried rosemary"
- " Salt and black pepper"
- "3 strands saffron optional"
- "1/4 cup plain flour to thicken"
- " Crusty bread to serve"
recipeinstructions:
- "One of the greatest things about his recipe is the different textures of the fish. To begin, heat your oil on a pan over a medium heat. Salt you salmon (on the non skin side) and place it face down on the hot oil. Cook for 5 minutes then flip. Cook on the skin side for 5 minutets. Remove from heat, discard the skin and set aside. Pre-cooking the salmon will ensure that it doesn&#39;t splinter in the Chowder."
- "In a large pot heat the butter using a low heat. When hot, add onion and garlic. Cook on a low heat for 5-7 minutes, or until fragrent. Add potato and celery. Cook on a low heat for 15 minutes, or until potato slightly softens."
- "Add your fish stock, then bring to the boil. While the water is boiling, prepare your whitefish by chopping it into large-ish (5cm chunks). When the water is boiled, throw in your white fish, prawns, rosemary and 1 teaspoon of ground black pepper. Place lid on pot and turn down to a low heat. Leave to cook for 30 minites."
- "Try the liquid mixture. Adjust for seasoning (depending on what fish-stock you are using, you might need to add salt). Chop your already fried salmon into similar sized chunks as the whitefish. Place in the pot."
- "Stir through the cream, turn up to medium heat. If you are using a little saffron, add it now. It won&#39;t bring much flavour, but it will add a lovely colour to your Chowder."
- "When the cream has heated (approx 3mins) add in your flour 1 spoon at a time, making sure it stirred through. You might need to add additional flour depending on consistency. Add extra flour 1 tablespoon at a time, until desired consistency is reached."
- "Enjoy with some crusty bread."
