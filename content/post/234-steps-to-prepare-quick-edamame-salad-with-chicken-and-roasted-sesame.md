Easy enough to pull together any day of the week. This simple Sesame Slaw with edamame makes a great side dish, or a bed for other items like gyoza, fried tofu, or grilled chicken. *Neutral salad oils do not have a strong flavor, and are a great base for dressing to allow other flavors to shine. Oils like canola, grapeseed oil, light olive oil, or safflower oil. This well-balanced composed vegetarian salad is refreshing, colorful, and (most important) beautiful. Thoroughly rinse any fresh produce and pat dry.
