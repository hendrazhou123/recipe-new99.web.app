recipeingredient:
- "4 center cut pork loin chops 1 12 2 thick"
- "1/2 cup red miso"
- "1 Tbsp honey"
- "2 tsps yellow mustard seed"
- "2 Tbsps  2 tsps olive oil"
- "2 tsps butter"
recipeinstructions:
- "Whisk the miso, 2 tablespoons of the oil and the honey together to combine. Place the pork chops in a shallow dish and slather on all sides with the miso mixture. I recommend marinating this overnight because the miso tenderizes the meat. The first time I made this, I marinated the pork for 8 hours and it was very good. The second time I marinated the pork for 36 hours and the chops were amazing. Place in the fridge until 30 minutes before needed."
- "Preheat the oven to 400."
- "Add the butter, the remaining oil and mustard seeds to an oven-safe skillet and heat over low heat until the butter is melted, the oil is very hot and the mustard seeds are starting to pop."
- "Remove the chops from the marinade and roughly remove the excess; you want some marinade left on the chops to create the caramelization that will make the difference between a good chop and a very good chop. Add the chops to the pan - do not crowd them so use as big a pan as you can or 2 pans if you have to - and sear the chops for 2 minutes on each side. Make sure that the heat is on low or you will have a smoky kitchen with which to contend."
- "Once the chops have been seared on the outside, place the pan in the oven and cook for 8 minutes. Remove from the oven, tent with foil and let rest about 5 minutes before serving. Make sure you whisk up and drizzle some of the pan juices over the top of each chop."
