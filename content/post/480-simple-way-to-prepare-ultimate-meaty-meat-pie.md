A delicious, thick, meaty filling is enveloped in a shortcrust pastry base. This French-Canadian meat pie is hearty, satisfying, easy to make, visually impressive, relatively affordable, and since it&#39;s best served at room temperature, doesn&#39;t require any kind of precise timing. Mincemeat Pie has been my favorite holiday pie since I was a little girl (that was awhile ago). My grandmother used to make her own homemade mincemeat.
