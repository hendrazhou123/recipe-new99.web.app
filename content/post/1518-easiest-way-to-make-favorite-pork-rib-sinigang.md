recipeinstructions:
- "Add a splash of veg oil to a wide, high-sided pan on medium-high heat. Add the onions and fry for 2 to 3 minutes until softened. Season the ribs with salt and pepper and add them to the pan. Sear about 2 minutes, then flip and sear about 2 minutes more. At the flip, add the garlic. As the ribs brown, move the onions and garlic around a bit so they don&#39;t burn."

- "Add the tomatoes and jalapeno to the pan. Cover, and let simmer for 1 1/2 hrs until the meat is tender. Add water as needed to keep the ribs submerged."
- "Remove the bay leaves and jalapeno. Add the eggplant and turn the heat back up to medium-high. Continue simmering uncovered for 5 minutes. Add the beans and bok choy and simmer another 5 minutes. Check the seasoning and add salt and freshly cracked black pepper to taste. Take the pan off the heat and add the spinach. Give the spinach a minute to wilt, then serve the soup hot with steamed rice."
