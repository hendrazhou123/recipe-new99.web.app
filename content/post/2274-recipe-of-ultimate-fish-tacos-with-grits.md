Instead of deep-frying the fish for these fish tacos, we coat the fish with a flavor-packed chile rub and grill it instead. Sometimes flipping fish on the grill can be tricky since the fish can stick to the grill or fall apart. These tasty grilled fish tacos are made with creamy lime dressing, crisp veggie toppings &amp; shredded Cabot cheese. When it comes to our fish tacos, it&#39;s all about what makes your taste buds sing.
