- "2 cups cold water"
- "1 teaspoon vinegar"

recipeinstructions:
- "Rinse the rice until the water is clear. (Normally takes 3 times)"
- "Add oil, salt, vinegar in cold water. Normally the rice /water ratio is 1:1. It depends on the type of rice. White rice like sushi rice or jasmine rice are 1:1; brown rice, red rice or wild rice should be 1:2 (1 cup of rice with 2 cups of water)"
