recipeingredient:
- "1 liter veggie stock I used two Kallo garlic and herb cubes"
- "1 1/2 cups chopped carrots"
- "1 1/2 cups chopped onions"
- "1 1/2 cupid chopped celery"
- "2 cups chopped potatoes"
- "1 tbs or so tomato paste"
- "2 tsp dried thyme"
- "1 tbs unsalted butter"
- "1 tbs flour"
- "1 tbs olive oil"
- " Sugar optional"
- " Fresh dill for garnish"
recipeinstructions:
- "In a stock pot or large sauce pan, saute carrots, onions, and celery in the olive oil until tender. I know my mirepoix proportions aren&#39;t traditional - you should use what works best for you."
- "Add in the stock, potatoes, tomato paste, and thyme. Stir to make sure the tomato paste is thoroughly combined."
- "Bring to a boil and then reduce heat to let simmer."

- "Turn up the heat on the soup mix and add the roux a bit at a time. Mix to make sure the roux is throughly incorporated, then lower heat to a simmer and reduce to desired thickness -- I go for runny but not watery."
- "My gf likes things a little sweet, so I added about a 1/2 tsp or so of sugar at this point. Personally, I&#39;d leave it out but it does round the taste a bit."
- "Let cool and then refrigerate for at least two hours to let the tastes combine. Reheat, garnish with fresh dill, and serve."
