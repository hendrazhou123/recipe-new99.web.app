- " Salt"
- " Pepper"
- "1 can Sweetcorn"
- "1 can black beans"
- "8 wholemeal tortillias"
- " Grated cheese to top"
recipeinstructions:
- "This sauce comes together quickly once you get started, so measure the dry ingredients (the flour, chili powder, cumin, garlic powder, oregano, salt and optional cinnamon) into a small bowl and place it near the stove. Place the tomato paste and broth near the stove as well."
- "In a medium-sized pot over medium heat, warm the oil until it’s it’s hot enough that a light sprinkle of the flour/spice mixture sizzles on contact."
- "Once it’s ready, pour in the flour and spice mixture. While whisking constantly, cook until fragrant and slightly deepened in color, about 1 minute. Whisk the tomato paste into the mixture, then slowly pour in the broth while whisking constantly to remove any lumps. Electronic whisker works very well here."
- "Keep on heat and continue to stir for 5 or so minutes. Sauce should become nice and thick. Remove from heat, then whisk in the vinegar and season to taste with a generous amount of freshly ground black pepper. Add more salt, if necessary."
- "In a large pan over medium heat, heat oil. Add onion and cook until soft, 5 minutes. Stir in garlic and cook until fragrant, 1 minute more. Add beef and cook until no longer pink, about 6 minutes. Drain fat."
- "Return beef mixture to pan over medium heat. Add chilli powder and cumin and season with salt and pepper, then stir in enchilada sauce. Bring to a simmer and cook until sauce thickens slightly, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in corn and black beans."
- "Add a large scoop of meat mixture onto each tortilla and roll up. Place rolled up tortillas side by side in a 23 x 33cm baking dish and top with cheeses then bake in the evening for 15 or so minutes."
- "And viola! Even had 2 leftover"
