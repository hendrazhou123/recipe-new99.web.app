- "Wrap your tortillas in foil and place in oven to warm while you prepare the rest of the garnishes."
- "Chop a good bunch of cilantro and stir this in with the tomato and lime. Chop your avocado and squeeze some lime juice over (using the other half of your lime from earlier.) Chop some green onions. Slice the 2nd lime for serving."
- "Remove your tortillas. Turn oven off and turn the heat off from beans. Now your ready to build your tacos!"
- "I start with the cheese first. Then the fish. Next I pile on the toppings."
