recipeinstructions:
- "Turn your stove on medium high heat and place your frying pan on it. Add about 1/2 tbsp of butter to the pan per egg. Put the pan on medium heat and let the butter melt evenly (spread the butter throughout the pan with a spatula if needed)."
- "Crack the eggs into the pan and let cook for about 1-2 minutes over medium heat. When the eggs whites are set (no longer liquidy), it’s time to flip the eggs. With a spatula, carefully flip the eggs, ensuring the yolk does not break."

- "If you like you could crack the eggs into a small bowl instead of directly into the pan, but I think it’s an extra and unnecessary step."
- "Don’t forget to put a bit of salt and pepper to taste it!"
- "Over medium eggs are great on their own, but are best enjoyed with toast or on top of an english muffin. Don’t eat them by themselves. My personal favorite is a blt with the over medium egg and cheese."
