Heat up oil in pan, then put in chili red pepper, Sichuan pepper firstly and fry until aromatic and then place garlic in. I used my Palermo Spiralizer for the potato and onion, and I used Hot and Spicy Chicken Sausage, instead of mild. Liberally salt and pepper the potatoes and sprinkle with garlic powder. Stir and turn again, turn the heat down a little and put a lid on the pan. When the potatoes are almost done add the onion to the pan.
