recipeingredient:
- "3-5 lbs boneless pork shoulder"
- "1 Tbsp vegetable oil"
- "1 bunch cilantro minced"
- "1 lime wedged"
- " Marinade"
- "1/2 cup orange juice"
- "1/2 cup lime juice"
- "15 cloves garlic minced"
- "1 Tbsp cumin"
- "2 Tbsp salt"
- "1 Tbsp black pepper"
- "1/2 cup cilantro or parsley chopped"
- "4 Tbsp olive oil"
- " More salt and pepper"
recipeinstructions:
- "Combine all the marinade ingredient in a large ziplock bag (2.5 gallon) or bowl. Debone/deskin the shoulder if needed. Add it to the marinade and turn to coat. Marinate at least 1 hour in the fridge but overnight is better."
- "Remove the roast, and truss with string. This keeps the roast together so it cuts and subsequently cooks better later. Salt the meat side of the roast again. This roast can take a decent amount of salt."
- "Pre heat your oven to 400F. If you have a convection oven, now is the time to use it. In a large dutch oven over medium-high heat, heat 1 tbsp of vegetable oil and sear the pork skin side up in the dutch oven. Salt and pepper the top (fat side) and then immediately transfer the roast in the dutch oven to the oven and cook at 400F uncovered for 1 hour. After 1 hour, reduce the oven temp to 300F and cook an additional 4 hours (or until the roast is 195F)"
- "Remove the roast from the oven and marvel at that crust."
- "Cover the roast with the lid, and let rest while you prepare sides. I recommend beans and yellow rice in the Cuban tradition."

When we have a crowd over for a game night, we love serving build-your own style meals. Chef Jose Enrique&#39;s version of the Puerto Rican classic pernil asado is extra-flavorful because he marinates the pork in lime and orange juices, as well as plenty of garlic, before roasting until the meat is caramelized and crispy. Though Puerto Ricans tend toward fatty cuts of pork with the skin on, lean cuts like pork loin are just as delicious with the intense garlic rub in this recipe. Rinse your roast and pat dry with a paper towel.
