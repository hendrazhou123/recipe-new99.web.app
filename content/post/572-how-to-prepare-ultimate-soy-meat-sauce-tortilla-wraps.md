Dried soy &#34;meat&#34; -- known to vegetarians as either TVP, textured vegetable protein, or TSP, textured soy protein -- makes a convenient addition to tofu and tempeh in your meatless repertoire. Unlike its animal counterpart, TVP stores long-term without refrigeration. Pile the tortillas on a plate and let everyone make their own wraps. The best way to do this is to spread the tortilla with some soured cream, then spoon the meat and some salad in the centre.
