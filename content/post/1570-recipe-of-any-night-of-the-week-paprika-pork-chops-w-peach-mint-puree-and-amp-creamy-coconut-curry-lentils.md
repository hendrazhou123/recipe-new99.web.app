Add the pork chops–they should make a bright sizzling sound immediately upon touching the pan; if they don&#39;t, take them out and let the pan and oil get a bit hotter."
- "Reduce the heat to medium and cook the chops, undisturbed, until they&#39;re well browned and they release from the pan of their own accord, about 4 minutes. Turn and repeat on the other side."
- "Remove the chops from pan and let sit, covered loosely with foil, for about 10 minutes. Serve hot."
- "Serve and enjoy!"
