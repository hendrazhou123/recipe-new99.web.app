It does not taste exactly like mac and cheese as it is a lot less greasy and doesn&#39;t have cheese in (go figure) but it is super creamy, flavourful and does come close! Italian mac and cheese is creamy, cheesy, and a little different then the usual mac and cheese. I found this recipe in one of Rachael Ray&#39;s cookbooks. When I saw it, I thought, &#34;Why didn&#39;t I think of that?&#34; Such a simple idea and so good.

When cheese has melted into sauce, add tomatoes. When sauce comes to a bubble, remove from heat and adjust seasonings, adding hot sauce if desired. Important: Don&#39;t forget tomato sauce for dunking. Given choice between mac and mashed potatoes, I think the answer is clear.
