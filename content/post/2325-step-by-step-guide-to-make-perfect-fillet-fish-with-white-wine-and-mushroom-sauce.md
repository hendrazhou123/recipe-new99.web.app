Last week I went fishing here in Long Island with some old friends from high school. They knew exactly what they were doing because we were all catching fish all day - striped bass, porgies. Cod, orange roughy or any other white fish works well in this recipe. casserole and top with mushroom mixture, scallions and vermouth; bake until fish is opaque and flakes easily I doubled the mushrooms and sauteed onions along with them, and used chicken stock instead of wine but it was. Place the fillets in the dish and turn to coat them with the wine mixture.
