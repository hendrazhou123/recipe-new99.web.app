A traditional Chinese dish with shiitake mushrooms. These braised mushrooms are delicious with a steaming bowl of jasmine rice. When braised correctly, they tasted meatier than meat, if that&#39;s possible! Start this recipe ahead of time; chilling the ribs after braising keeps them from falling falling apart when they served (and all braised meats taste better the next day).
