Spicy Alaska Pollock Stew wit Gochujang (Dongtae Jjigae) is a favorite Korean stew that is made with frozen Alaska Pollock. Is our local market selling a different fish disguised as an Alaska pollock? Koreans have been found to sell different fish you know - there was a scandal while back where. Koreans have an expression, &#34;shiwonhada&#34; (시원하다)—literally, &#34;intensely refreshing and cooling&#34;—that describes Add spiciness to that party and you&#39;ll take shiwonhada to the next level. To me, the dish that perfectly captures this experience is the spicy fish stew called maeuntang (매운탕).
