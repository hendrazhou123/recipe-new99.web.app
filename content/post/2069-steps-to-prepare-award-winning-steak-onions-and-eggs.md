I really like the subtle heat this cheese gives to the whole thing, but. Cooked eggs: Scrambled eggs are fine to freeze, but it is advised to not freeze cooked egg whites. Place an egg on top of rice in the center of each bowl and drizzle some gochujang sauce around yolks. Arrange onion, turnips, broccoli rabe, and sliced steak around eggs (you can add egg and other toppings while rice is still toasting). Sprinkle Seasoning evenly over both sides of steak.
