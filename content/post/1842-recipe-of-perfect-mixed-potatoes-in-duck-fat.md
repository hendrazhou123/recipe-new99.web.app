Mashed potatoes reimagined in the most delicious way! The duck fat potatoes were quite the same, but for some reason (I am still looking at you, oven) turned out a tad darker and crispier. There was a slight (veeeery slight) difference in flavor from the goose fat, but I can&#39;t quite figure out what it isâ€¦ I suppose, the goose fat was just being a bit more &#39;plain&#39;, or. This easy side features crispy skinned potatoes with soft flavorful interiors. First the potatoes are boiled in liberally salted water, before they are lovingly smashed into thick patties.
