1. Make dough by making a well in the middle of the flour. Place the eggs in the well and stir. Gradually pull in flour until you get a dough. Knead dough and wrap in plastic. Allow it to rest for 45-60 minutes.
1. Prep veggies and season meat.

1. Add onion and garlic into pan with the drippings from the meat. Cook for a couple minutes. Add in the tomato sauce, crushed tomatoes and sun-dried tomatoes. Season sauce and add in a few shakes of Worcestershire sauce. Cover and simmer on low heat.
1. Divide dough into quarters. Flour ravioli pan and place filling into depressions. I found that by rolling the dough thin, I can fill and seal the ravioli with one sheet of dough. Return any unused meat to the sauce. Keep on low heat and stir occasionally.
1. Using a rolling pin, roll over the ravioli plate to free them. Place on a sheet to dry for 20 minutes or so. Save scrap dough. You can cut them into extra noodles). Boil ravioli about 4 minutes. Ladle a couple scoops of pasta water into the sauce to thin it out.
1. Serve. I topped mine with shredded cheddar and made some garlic cheese bread.


Cook the sauce up to two days ahead, and reheat gently over medium-low heat before serving. Prepare a double batch of the sauce while you&#39;re at it, and freeze half to toss with pasta for a quick dinner later. You can prepare the ravioli filling up to a day in advance; fill and cook the ravioli just before serving. Meat ravioli were my favourite and, indeed, are the traditional - and the most popular - ravioli, served with melted butter fl avoured with fresh sage and garlic. It makes a pasta that is less delicate and less smooth in texture, but with a definite flavour, particularly suitable for vegetable sauces.
