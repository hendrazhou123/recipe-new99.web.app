recipeinstructions:

- "Peel the potatoes, carrots, and onions. Cut those and the beef into bite size pieces. *It will be better to cut the potatoes bigger since they tend to become smaller as it stews."
- "Soak potatoes in water for 10 mins to remove scum."
- "Stir-fry vegetables with oil."
- "Add beef and stir-fry again."
- "Add water little by little and stir gently."

- "Or... If you want to eat right away on the day you cooked, cool down once and then heat again. &#34;Stew → cool down &amp; rest → stew&#34; is the best method to make this curry richer. But, I would say 2nd day curry is much better!"
- "To cool it down quickly, soak the pan in a bigger pan with cold water. Change the water several times as it becomes warm."
- "Heat the curry to serve. Put rice in a bowl, pour curry, add Fukushinzuke pickles and done!"

Japanese curry (カレー, karē) is commonly served in three main forms: curry rice (カレーライス, karē raisu, curry over rice), curry udon (curry over noodles), and curry bread (a curry-filled pastry). • Japanese curry is very different from Indian curries. You could use any kind of meat you like, but beef may be the most popular one for Japanese curry. It&#39;s eaten with sticky white rice which goes very well with this curry.
