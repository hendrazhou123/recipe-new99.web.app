recipeinstructions:
- "Measure 1 cup rice and 1 cup toor dal. Grind it coarsely. To ensure additional fragrance in the recipe, you can also dry roast the rice and dal in low flame and grind it."
- "In the mix, throw in 3 red chillies, 1/2 sprig curry leaves, cumin seeds, black peppercorns and grind them all just for 10 seconds."
- "Now in a heavy bottom pan; preferably steel, add in all the oils in the said quantity. Throw in mustard seeds, chana dal, urad dal, 1/2 sprig curry leaves, asafoetida, 2 red chillies. Sauté them in low flame till they turn fragrant."
- "Then, add in 4 cups of water - preferably hot to speed up the cooking. Cover it and let the water reach a roller boil.

This is a wholesome meal. It can be consumed as such or with a side of chuney and sambar or; with plain whole yoghurt."
