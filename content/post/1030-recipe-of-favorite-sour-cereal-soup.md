Prep time says one hour because you need to bake the squash before putting it in the soup. In blender, puree squash with sour cream. This healthy version of cream of mushroom soup uses reduced-fat sour cream and low-fat milk to make it creamy while keeping the fat in check. Fresh tarragon and nutmeg flavor it. Wow, this soup was so creamy!
