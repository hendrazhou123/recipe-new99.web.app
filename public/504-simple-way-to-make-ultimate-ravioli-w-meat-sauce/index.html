<li>Make dough by making a well in the middle of the flour. Place the eggs in the well and stir. Gradually pull in flour until you get a dough. Knead dough and wrap in plastic. Allow it to rest for 45-60 minutes.</li>
<li>Prep veggies and season meat.</li>
<li>Half way through cooking the ground meats, add in the jalapeños and half of the diced mushrooms. Cook until meat is done. Remove with slotted spoon and reserve. (Do not clean pan)</li>
<li>Add onion and garlic into pan with the drippings from the meat. Cook for a couple minutes. Add in the tomato sauce, crushed tomatoes and sun-dried tomatoes. Season sauce and add in a few shakes of Worcestershire sauce. Cover and simmer on low heat.</li>
<li>Divide dough into quarters. Flour ravioli pan and place filling into depressions. I found that by rolling the dough thin, I can fill and seal the ravioli with one sheet of dough. Return any unused meat to the sauce. Keep on low heat and stir occasionally.</li>
<li>Using a rolling pin, roll over the ravioli plate to free them. Place on a sheet to dry for 20 minutes or so. Save scrap dough. You can cut them into extra noodles). Boil ravioli about 4 minutes. Ladle a couple scoops of pasta water into the sauce to thin it out.</li>
<li>Serve. I topped mine with shredded cheddar and made some garlic cheese bread.</li>
</ol>
<p>Cook the sauce up to two days ahead, and reheat gently over medium-low heat before serving. Prepare a double batch of the sauce while you're at it, and freeze half to toss with pasta for a quick dinner later. You can prepare the ravioli filling up to a day in advance; fill and cook the ravioli just before serving. Meat ravioli were my favourite and, indeed, are the traditional - and the most popular - ravioli, served with melted butter fl avoured with fresh sage and garlic. It makes a pasta that is less delicate and less smooth in texture, but with a definite flavour, particularly suitable for vegetable sauces.</p>
